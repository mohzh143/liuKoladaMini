Description: 
    A minimal R package for accessing and visualizing Swedish municipal 
    performance indicators from the Kolada API. Provides comprehensive 
    functions to retrieve municipality metadata, search key performance 
    indicators (KPIs), fetch time-series data, and create visualizations.
    
    Key features include:
    - Retrieve complete lists of Swedish municipalities and counties with 
      metadata using kld_municipalities()
    - Search and browse available KPIs by title or category with 
      kld_indicators()
    - Fetch time-series data for specific municipalities and KPIs across 
      multiple years with kld_values()
    - Generate quick line plots for data visualization with kld_plot()
    
    The package handles API response normalization, data type conversion, 
    and includes robust error handling. Designed for reproducibility with 
    comprehensive unit tests using recorded HTTP fixtures for offline testing.
    Ideal for researchers, analysts, and students working with Swedish 
    municipal statistics.
