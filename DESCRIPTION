Description: 
    A minimal R package for accessing and visualizing Swedish municipal 
    performance indicators from the Kolada API. Provides functions to 
    retrieve municipality metadata, search key performance indicators (KPIs), 
    fetch time-series data, and create visualizations. Key features include: 
    retrieving complete lists of Swedish municipalities and counties with 
    metadata using kld_municipalities(); searching and browsing available KPIs 
    by title or category with kld_indicators(); fetching time-series data for 
    specific municipalities and KPIs across multiple years with kld_values(); 
    and generating quick line plots for data visualization with kld_plot(). 
    Handles API response normalization and includes unit tests with recorded 
    HTTP fixtures.
